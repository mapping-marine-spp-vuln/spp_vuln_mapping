# Summary

With vulnerability maps by species, FE, and FV-weighted FE, we can calculate impacts simply by multiplying vulnerability and stressor intensity.  This approach will not work for fisheries (since exposure is not simply to activity, but *targeted* activity) or thermal variation (since impact will be related to tolerance, determined at the species level).

# Data

See script 3 for vulnerability mapping scripts.
